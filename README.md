## torque_engine_notifications

Let's say you're a Python web developer. Then -- just for sake of argument -- say that you happen to like using both the [Pyramid][] web framework and [nTorque][] task queue. Then say for some obscure reason that you also liked the idea of a dual-queue work engine system *so much* that you based your *entire* application architecture on the fast moving, highly specific and undocumented [pyramid_torque_engine][].

Well! Then it's only reasonable that you should tire of manually configuring hooks and subscribers every time you need to dispatch a notification.
